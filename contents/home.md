#### Biography
I am currently a Distinguished Professor at the School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Kunming University of Science and Technology. Currently, I'am leading the research grouop of Machine Intelligence Maintenance (MIM).

My research interests lie in aritificaill intelligence and their application in machine intelligent maintenance, such machine anomaly detection, fault diagnosis & prognosis. My focus also includes developing interpretable machine learning models, aiming to improve the interpretability and generalizability of intelligent fault diagnosis methods.

I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University. My thesis title is Research on Interpretable Wavelet Deep Neural Network and Its Application in Machine Intelligent Diagnosis. My supervisor is Professor [Xuefeng Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h47O1xYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and my co-supervisor is Professor [Chuang Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RpI75ZIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My focus is on developing interpretable and efficient intelligent diagnosis models. In addition, I have participated in the research of many National Natural Science Foundation projects and am the person in charge of a Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universitie (No.xzy022021005).

I was also fortunate to join the EPFL Intelligent Operation and Maintenance Laboratory as a visiting doctoral student from October 2022 to October 2023, with co-supervisor Professor [Olga Fink](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eAcIoUgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to study graph neural networks and machine anomaly detection.
